            If you are still young, don't be afraid of failure, the more time you fail, the more experience you accumulate, most successful people find the exit to success in the experience of failure. Many people are afraid of failure and even hate it, but they forget that only failure can find the way to success, as Kuo once said: "Success is a poor teacher, it gives you ignorance and courage, but not the experience and wisdom necessary for the next success."
            <br>
            <br>
            Just because you are young, you should not be afraid of failure, but learn from it and slowly find the right path. Everyone has only 24 hours in a day and can actually do a lot of things. <span>
                It is because everyone uses their time differently in a day that makes the difference in the future. Don't let yourself feel sorry when you get old, just do whatever comes to your mind now!
                <br>
                <br>
                We need to take risks, because the biggest crisis in life is the fear of taking risks.
